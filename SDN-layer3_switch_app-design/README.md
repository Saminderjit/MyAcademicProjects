Designed and developed a layer 3 switch application using Ryu SDN controller, mininet and OpenFlow v1.3 which

sends LLDP packets between the switches to detect link failure problems, updates ARP tables for new flow , flow 

tables with idle timeout and hard timeouts , switches send port state changes to the controller in case port is added 

,deleted or modified.
